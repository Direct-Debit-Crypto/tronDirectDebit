# Tron Direct Debit Solution
A direct debit solution on TRON network

## Project Info/Details:
A trust environment in a trustless world. The main goal is to pay the people that offered you some services in an automatic way. For that a provider account is created and is top up with a certain amount(This would be in CeFi a client with a bank account). Now we have a global budget. The next step is to set some vendors/suppliers/members of DAO in a whitelist(This would be the old supplier ex: electricity company, phone company, etc). Now every vendor can emit an "invoice" which would be paid automatic. It relies heavily on trust. As magnificent as is a trustless way of payments it's important to remember that we are humans and we rely on trust.
